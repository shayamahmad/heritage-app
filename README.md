Smart India Hackathon 2024 - Problem Statement SIH-1648


Problem Statement Description:
Background: Visitors to museums often face several significant challenges due to manual ticket booking systems. One prominent issue is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. Long queues are common, especially during peak hours, weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance, double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers. Description: The implementation of a chatbot for ticket booking in a museum addresses several critical needs, enhancing the overall visitor experience and streamlining museum operations. Here are the key reasons for adopting a chatbot ticket booking system: 1. Improved Customer Service 2. Efficient Handling of High Volumes 3. Cost-Effective Solution 4. Data Collection and Analysis 5. Accessibility 6. Reduced Human Error 7. Multilingual Support 8. Enhanced Marketing and Promotion Expected Solution: An efficient and responsive multilingual chatbot based ticketing system that can handle all kinds of bookings from gate entry to shows. Payment gateway should also be integrated to make it fully free from human intervention. It will also provide analytics to aid in more efficient decision making process.
